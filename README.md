Monte Carlo Simulation and Physics-Informed Machine Learning Potentials for Binary Nanoparticle Systems

# 1. Introduction
This project investigates the self-assembly behavior of binary nanoparticle systems, which are composed of two types of nanoparticles (e.g., hydrophobic/hydrophilic or magnetic/non-magnetic particles). These systems exhibit complex behaviors such as clustering, partial ordering, and crystallization. By modifying the inter-particle attractions, such as electrostatic forces, van der Waals interactions, or ligand binding, we aim to control the self-assembly process and obtain ordered structures at different scales.

  ## 1.1 Key Motivations
The primary motivation behind this project is to understand how varying inter-particle interactions affect the energy and structural ordering in binary nanoparticle systems. This research has significant potential applications, particularly in fields such as drug delivery, materials science, and optoelectronics. By manipulating these interactions, we can design programmable nanomaterials and responsive assemblies with tunable properties.

  ## 1.2 Research Significance
This project aims to enhance our understanding of structural evolution and phase transitions in nanoparticle systems, focusing on how nanoparticles shift between gas-like, liquid-like, and crystalline phases. This research contributes to nanomaterial formation and self-assembly processes. Practical applications include designing nanomaterials for targeted drug delivery, where nanoparticles respond to stimuli for controlled release, as well as innovations in responsive nanoparticle assemblies for optoelectronics and other technologies.

  ## 1.3 Innovation
One of the innovative aspects of this project is the combination of Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning. By using machine learning to predict the system's energy, we aim to replace traditional Lennard-Jones potential calculations, speeding up the energy evaluation process. This approach can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of simulations, especially in systems with many particles or complex interactions.
